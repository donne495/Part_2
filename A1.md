# Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp
This application is a game in which the user must build and maintain a campground for a collection of friendly animal visitors. In addition to fishing, catching bugs, and gathering fruit as gifts to strengthen their friendship with the animals, they must also plant flowers and complete building projects to customize their campsite. The game also contains a minor social aspect, encouraging users to make friends with other campers and visit their campsites for inspiration. I chose this app because I personally found it enjoyable; it can be a calming source of distraction without requiring too much time commitment or skill. The app also intrigued me because of the public reaction to the game prior to its release. Nintendo, the company that released it, put a lot of effort into marketing it, and I was curious to see how they would keep users engaged once they actually downloaded the app.<br/>

Most people who download this app use it as a source of slow-paced, cheerful entertainment. Based on the reviews in the app store, it has been highly popular with fans of the original Animal Crossing games, which makes sense given the strong sense of nostalgia that often surrounds Nintendo’s products. When analyzing the technologies used, it is important to note that Animal Crossing is designed for simplicity and safety; while many of its users are adults, it is still marketed as a family game and is intended to be used by children. Thus, it collects very little outside data, minimizing the risk of users unwittingly divulging personal information. For this reason, the camera, microphone, and GPS are not used, and the app relies solely on touchscreen controls to allow the user to navigate and Wi-Fi to connect to other players. What makes this app’s use of smartphone technology novel isn’t the specific components it uses, but that it is available for phones at all; most of the companies that Nintendo competes with focus on developing games exclusively for consoles or gaming PCs. This approach can be prohibitive to most ordinary users, who have neither the time nor the budget to install a fancy gaming setup. Thus, Nintendo’s initiative to make their originally console-based game lightweight enough to be used on a device that most people already own was both highly innovative and an excellent business tactic, bringing the fun of console gaming to a much wider market.<br/>

Animal Crossing’s strengths lie in the fact that it is immersive, easy to master, and visually appealing. However, it is quite demanding in terms of memory and relies on frequent updates, meaning the user must often wait for downloads to finish before they can play. Given that the app is trying to replicate a console game on a much smaller screen, it also struggles with overcrowding at times; to fix this, I would definitely suggest that they decrease the amount of notifications appearing on the screen and focus on only showing the icons necessary for navigation.<br/><br/><br/>



# Transit
This application is a guide for public transit users, providing real-time updates on bus locations and schedules. It also provides a route planner called GO, which provides users with step-by-step instructions for getting to their desired destination by bus. Transit is particularly interesting because the scheduling information it provides is crowdsourced: instead of relying solely on route schedules or the city’s transit tracking system, which only provide a general idea of where each bus is supposed to be, people using the GO feature can opt to share their current location, in which case the exact position of the bus that they are riding will show up on the maps of all the other users currently waiting for it. <br/>

I chose this app because it is something that I use daily, and if I find it this helpful, it is likely that others do too. Halifax Transit is notoriously unreliable; the 1 is only on schedule 47% of the time during peak hours (Woodbury, 2018), and I suspect that that fact would not come as a surprise to anyone at Dalhousie. Provided that you are the kind of individual that does not enjoy being late 53% of the time, the appeal of Transit is obvious; it takes a lot of guesswork out of catching the right bus. <br/>

To keep its users informed, Transit mainly uses GPS and cellular data. Once it pinpoints the user’s location, it lists the closest stop and displays a list of bus routes and departure times, then once the user boards a bus, the location information gets used to make the app’s scheduling predictions more accurate for everyone else. The app even provides incentives for users who share their location information often, providing statistics on how many people they have helped and how they compare to other users in their community.<br/>

While the idea of crowdsourcing bus schedules is quite novel, Transit’s user interface proves to be both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. On the positive side, the minimalist homepage is self-explanatory and great for checking your current status at a glance, but the lack of buttons or tabs for performing more complicated operations makes the process much more confusing. For example, clicking on an individual route pulls up a list of the next three departure times for your stop, but if a user wants to know how long it will take to get to their intended destination, it is not particularly obvious that you can then scroll down to see a schedule for all the stops along the route. Exiting the GO screen also proves to be frustrating, as it is the only page upon which users are expected to swipe down to go back to the main page. Thus, if I was given the opportunity to improve the app, I would likely choose to sacrifice its minimalist appearance a little, adding additional buttons that better conform to the features iOS users expect.
